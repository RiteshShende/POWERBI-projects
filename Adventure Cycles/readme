The goal is to build a data-driven BI system based on free data and your choice to cross with one or more multi-format sources to include this heterogeneity problem.

We must build the cube and then generate two reports that you consider relevant.

We will have to take into account the different stages of analysis, transformation, aggregation.

The following points must be taken into consideration:

The choice of the environment (ETL, Database, BI Platform ...)
Presentation and method of analysis.
The structure of the reports
Optimization
